# Translating human word to plant word

if you have a sentance "I love water!"
it would translate it as "Imus lophylumvellia wativatelliar!"

if there is:
- char i, it would concatenate with "mus"
- char a, it would concatenate with "tiva"
- char e, it would concatenate with "llia"
- char o, it would concatenate with "phylum"

P.S:
i get this study case from 30 challage. How ever i forgot the challange title :(
